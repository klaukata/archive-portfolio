        <h2>purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>
            My goal was to learn how asynchronous code works by learning how to 
            <span style="color: var(--violet)">implement data fetching</span>.
            Is there a better way to learn how to do 
            something, other than practicing it? Honestly, I don't think so.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>user stories:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>is responsive</li>
            <li>matches previously designed UI</li>
            <li>has a button that switches all temperatures from Celcius to 
                Fahrenheit and vice versa</li>
            <li>includes a heading that displays "Today" or "Tomorrow" 
                depending on the circle that was clicked</li>
            <li>displays an 8-hour forecast</li>
            <li>8-hour forecast' circles are clickable. Once clicked, the div 
                changes its colors, weather details section, and elements that 
                display the current temperature and weather icon</li>
            <li>"weather details" section contains eight divs, each displaying: 
                sunrise, sunset, precipitation, humidity, UV index, visibility 
                and "feels like" temperature </li>
            <li>background-color changes depending on a temperature</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>challenges</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Squares are overflowing</li>
                <p>Originally, I assumed that I will tackle the squares' layout by using Flexbox. After lots of maneuvering this is the best I could achieve:</p>
                <img src="img/challange-overflow.png" alt="picture of quares overflowing">
                <p>At this point, I knew that <span>re-learning Grid</span>, after years of not using it, will do the trick. And I was right.</p>
                <img src="img/challange-overflow-after.png" alt="">
            <li>Squares have a fixed size</li>
                <p>At first, I defined each square's width and height by px x px. After I applied the Grid layout, I started wondering how to prevent having to set a different px value for every size. I switched to already known relative units: vh/vw, em, rem, %. To no avail. </p>
                <p>A solution to this problem came instantaneously after learning CSS Grid's <span>fr unit</span>.</p>
            <li>Two event listeners added to the same element</li>
                <p>Since I wanted squares to change color during mouse press and hover simultaneously, I thought I could nest one event listener inside another. Well, turns out you can't. <span style="color: var(--gray)">At least I couldn't make it work.</span></p>
                <p>I needed to find a way to omit one of the listeners, so I declared mousePosition variable:</p>
                <img style="width: 80%" src="img/challange-mousePosition.png" alt="">
                <p>And used in an if statement inside of the 'mouseover' event lister:</p>
                <img  src="img/challange-mousePosition-nested.png" alt="">
            <li>'Not allowed' cursor</li>
                <img style="width: 100%" src="img/challange-cursor-gif.gif" alt="">
                <p>Since I started working on this application, I encountered this random cursor change while coloring squares. At first, I assumed that it was my mouse (that had been dropped countless times) just acting up, so I simply ignored it. When I was finishing this project, however, and my to-do list got smaller and smaller, I started thinking that maybe it was not my mouse's fault at all.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_cursor.asp">W3Schools</a> explains that a not allowed cursor implies that "The cursor indicates that the requested action will not be executed". So I started thinking: What action does the browser think I want to do here? I had no idea, angry and frustrated, I abandoned the whole project until I dragged the Google logo on my homepage a few days later. And that was when it hit me: <span style="color: var(--dark-green)">the browser did not allow me to drag squares</span>! Of course! </p>
                <p>So I made each hovered-over square <span>undraggable</span>, with this line of code:</p>
                <img style="width: 50%" src="img/challange-cursor.png" alt="">
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <p>
            Through this project, I learned how APIs and asynchronous code work. 
            Even though I planned to style this application using 
            <span style="color: var(--gray)">(unknown to me at that time)</span> 
            CSS preprocessor, which is Sass, after figuring out how easy it is,
            I got to style most of an app with Bootstrap.
