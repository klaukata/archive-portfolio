        <h2>purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>
            My goal was to learn how asynchronous code works by learning how to 
            <span style="color: var(--violet)">implement data fetching</span>.
            Is there a better way to learn how to do 
            something, other than practicing it? Honestly, I don't think so.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>user stories:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>is responsive</li>
            <li>matches previously designed UI</li>
            <li>has a button that switches all temperatures from Celcius to 
                Fahrenheit and vice versa</li>
            <li>includes a heading that displays "Today" or "Tomorrow" 
                depending on the circle that was clicked</li>
            <li>displays an 8-hour forecast</li>
            <li>8-hour forecast' circles are clickable. Once clicked, the div 
                changes its colors, weather details section, and elements that 
                display the current temperature and weather icon</li>
            <li>"weather details" section contains eight divs, each displaying: 
                sunrise, sunset, precipitation, humidity, UV index, visibility 
                and "feels like" temperature </li>
            <li>background-color changes depending on a temperature</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>challenges</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Every time user enters input, the website reloads</li>
                <p>The form section on this app is not sending an input 
                    anywhere and js was programmed in a way that it simply 
                    takes an input.value parameter when submit button or enter 
                    is clicked.</p>
                <p>Learning that it's clear that we don't need a page to reload, 
                    so to prevent that, I learned about 
                    <span style="color: var(--yellow)">onsubmit event</span> 
                    and used it accordingly:</p>
                <img src="img/challange-reload.png" alt="">
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <p>
            Through this project, I learned how APIs and asynchronous code work. 
            Even though I planned to style this application using 
            <span style="color: var(--gray)">(unknown to me at that time)</span> 
            CSS preprocessor, which is Sass, after figuring out how easy it is,
            I got to style most of an app with Bootstrap.
