    <h1>Rock Paper Scissors game</h1>
    <p>the classical 2-payer game where each player chooses either rock, paper or scissors and reveals their choices simultaneously. but this time it's you vs. the code!</p>

        <h2>purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>I wanted to get familiar with DOM, and I decided to achieve that by building many projects.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>general requirements</h2>
        <p>As always, apart from the bare minimum that the generated website must be responsive. I had a few requirements in mind to be able to call this project a success:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The resulting website must match the design on a Figma file, that I created for it </li>
            <li>Add an animation that makes an image of what user/computer chose bigger</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>challenges</h2>
        <p>Surprisingly, for me, I had some issues with scope. Variables that were defined outside of the function were not 'found' by my code editor, so at my first attempt, I nested all of my code inside of the one function. After I decided to rewrite my code this problem never surfaced again, so I am not completely sure what I did wrong the first time. However i suspect that I must have simply misspelled variable names.</p>
