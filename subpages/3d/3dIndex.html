        <h2>general info</h2>
            <p>this project was created to pass FreeCodeCamp's <a class="gray" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">"responsive web design"</a> course.</p>
            <p>i was instructed to build something similar to <a href="https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks/"  target="_blank">this</a> landing page. however,  i found its structure a little bit too easy for my liking. at that time i was fascinated by Figma's community section and that's when i found my inspiration.</p>
        <h2>challenges</h2>
        <p>back then i had no idea how Document Object Model works but i still wanted to include a <span>sidebar menu.</span></p>
        <p>that is when i started to learn how valuable and functional javascript can be for a website. i also learned that is way more manageable to just add a CSS class to a particular element instead of doing everything in javascript alone.</p>
