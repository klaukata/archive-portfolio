        <h2>purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>The goal was to create a basic "sketchbook" that operates like a mouse-controlled Etch-a-Sketch: hovering over and pressing a square would color it with a random or fixed color. Changing the size of given squares would reset any previous modifications.</p>
        <p>This project is a slightly altered version of <br><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch" target="_blank" style="color: var(--violet)"> The Odin Project's assignment</a>, where the final result would be a bit less complex since it required just a hover effect present.</p>

        <h2>general requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>the webpage had to be responsive</li>
            <li>must match the design on a Figma file, that I created for it</li>
            <li>the color change must work seamlessly</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>challenges</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Squares are overflowing</li>
                <p>Originally, I assumed that I will tackle the squares' layout by using Flexbox. After lots of maneuvering this is the best I could achieve:</p>
                <img src="img/challange-overflow.png" alt="picture of quares overflowing">
                <p>At this point, I knew that re-learning Grid, after years of not using it, will do the trick. And I was right.</p>
                <img src="img/challange-overflow-after.png" alt="">
            <li>Squares have a fixed size</li>
                <p>At first, I defined each square's width and height by px x px. After I applied the Grid layout, I started wondering how to prevent having to set a different px value for every size. I switched to already known relative units: vh/vw, em, rem, %. To no avail. </p>
                <p>A solution to this problem came instantaneously after learning CSS Grid's fr unit.</p>
            <li>Two event listeners added to the same element</li>
                <p>Since I wanted squares to change color during mouse press and hover simultaneously, I thought I could nest one event listener inside another. Well, turns out you can't. At least I couldn't make it work.</p>
                <p>I needed to find a way to omit one of the listeners, so I declared mousePosition variable:</p>
                <img style="width: 80%" src="img/challange-mousePosition.png" alt="">
                <p>And used in an if statement inside of the 'mouseover' event lister:</p>
                <img  src="img/challange-mousePosition-nested.png" alt="">
            <li>'Not allowed' cursor</li>
                <img src="img/challange-cursor-gif.gif" alt="">
                <p>Since I started working on this application, I encountered this random cursor change while coloring squares. At first, I assumed that it was my mouse (that had been dropped countless times) just acting up, so I simply ignored it. When I was finishing this project, however, and my to-do list got smaller and smaller, I started thinking that maybe it was not my mouse's fault at all.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_cursor.asp">W3Schools</a> explains that a not allowed cursor implies that "The cursor indicates that the requested action will not be executed". So I started thinking: What action does the browser think I want to do here? I had no idea, angry and frustrated, I abandoned the whole project until I dragged the Google logo on my homepage a few days later. And that was when it hit me: the browser did not allow me to drag squares! Of course! </p>
                <p>So I made each hovered-over square undraggable, by this line of code:</p>
                <img src="img/challange-cursor.png" alt="">
        </ol>
