        <h2>purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>The goal was to create a basic "sketchbook" that operates like a mouse-controlled Etch-a-Sketch: hovering over and pressing a square would color it with a random or fixed color. Changing the size of given squares would reset any previous modifications.</p>
        <p>This project is a slightly altered version of <br><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch" target="_blank" style="color: var(--violet)"> The Odin Project's assignment</a>, where the final result would be a bit less complex since it required just a hover effect present.</p>

        <h2>general requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>the webpage had to be responsive</li>
            <li>must match the design on a Figma file, that I created for it</li>
            <li>the color change must work seamlessly</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>challenges</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Squares are overflowing</li>
            <p>Originally, I assumed that I will tackle the squares' layout by using Flexbox. After lots of maneuvering this is the best I could achieve:</p>

            <p>At this point, I knew that re-learning Grid, after years of not using it, will do the trick. And I was right.</p>
