        <h2>purpose and goal</h2>
        <p>The goal was to create a basic "sketchbook" that operates like a mouse-controlled Etch-a-Sketch: hovering over and pressing a square would color it with a random or fixed color. Changing the size of given squares would reset any previous modifications.</p>
        <p>This project is a slightly altered version of <br><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch" target="_blank" style="color: var(--violet)"> The Odin Project's assignment</a>, where the final result would be a bit less complex since it required just a hover effect present.</p>

        <h2>general requirements</h2>
        <p>As always, apart from the bare minimum that the generated website must be responsive. I had a few <span style="color: var(--violet)">requirements</span> in mind to be able to call this project a success:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The resulting website must match the design on a Figma file, that I created for it </li>
            <li>Add an animation that makes an image of what user/computer chose bigger</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>challenges</h2>
        <p>Surprisingly, for me, I had some issues with <span style="color: var(--yellow)">scopes of variables</span>. Variables that were defined outside of the function were not 'found' by my code editor, so at my first attempt, I nested all of my code inside of the one function. After I decided to rewrite my code this problem never surfaced again, so I am not completely sure what I did wrong the first time. However, I suspect that I must have simply misspelled variable names.</p>
